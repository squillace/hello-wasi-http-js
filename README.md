# Hello WASI:HTTP from JavaScript
This repository contains a simple wasi:http implementation of a web server in JavaScript using the @bytecodealliance/preview2-shim types and @bytecodealliance/jco tooling to build the wasm component. This component should work in any wasm component runtime, but for now that's wasmtime or jco (node).
